# PeerSphere: The Student Platform

Every semester, students get to choose their favourite combination of teachers and sections. But not everyone can get what they want. In the end, it's fastest finger first.

This leads to a huge amount of spam mails flooding the university inboxes of every student across batches, from those desperately looking to find someone willing to swap their section.

## PeerSphere fixes this problem.
By connecting students across different sections, by simply registering with their university email addresses, PeerSphere effectively solves the issue of finding the right person to swap your class with.

All you have to do is simply visit the PeerSphere homepage.

Just login using your University email ID, and register yourself in the database!

Now, you'll be able to view the database and get in touch with other students looking to swap classes with you.

And if you just want to get used to the site, there is a fully simulated site demo to get the hang of it! Just hit the demo button on the home page.

With a fully responsive UI that looks great on phones AND desktops, PeerSphere makes the whole section selection process a breeze.
